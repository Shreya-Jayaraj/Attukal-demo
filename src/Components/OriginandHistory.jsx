                <p>The story goes that the Goddess Bhagavathy revealed herself to a fervent devotee 
                    of a notable family viz. Mulluveettil family. It is 
                    said that one evening a young girl appeared before
                     the head of the family while he was performing his
                      oblations in the Killi river and requested him to 
                      help her cross the river. Impressed by her charismatic
                       demeanour, the- old man bent before her with awe and
                        reverence and not only helped her cross the river
                         but took her to his house nearby. Strangely enough,
                          while the household members were amidst preparations for
                           intending a warm welcome to the young girl, she vanished.
                            That very night she appeared as an icon before the old man in his 
                            dream and demanded that he should establish an abode
                             for her in the nearby sacred ground of shrubs and 
                             herbs (kavu), at a consecrated spot marked by three 
                             lines. The next morning the old man went to the spot
                              revealed to him in the dream and to his great
                               surprise he did find
                            three marks indented on the ground.</p>
